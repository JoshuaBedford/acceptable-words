# acceptable-words
A JSON array of words that contain profanity and other such words that are normally prohibited. For use in filters to whitelist certain words that would otherwise be blocked.

# Whitelist
This is a JSON array of words that are probably fine, but might get blocked by a filter that looks at partial words, such as the validator extension of my Laravel Word Filter package. I use it for usernames.

# Blacklist
This is a JSON array of words and phrases that should not be allowed. I borrowed/stole/based it off of [zacanger/profane-words](https://github.com/zacanger/profane-words)
